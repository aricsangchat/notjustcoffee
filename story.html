    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p style="max-width:78ch;">
      We invite you to taste first — without knowing the details. Only after that, reveal the lot.
      This approach comes from a coffee lab background where blind cuppings were always the starting point.

      <h2>Why “Not Just Coffee”</h2>
      <p style="max-width:78ch;">
        Coffee is a portal. For most people it’s simply caffeine — but in truth, coffee is far greater.
        It holds the labor of families, their hands, their care for the land — and the quiet intelligence of process.
      </p>

      <h3 style="margin-top:18px;">Words from the Founder, Natalia Sangchat</h3>
      <p style="max-width:78ch;">
        The tasting process itself is a ritual. When approached consciously, it enhances the quality of life —
        and the quality of your presence within it.
      </p>
      <p style="max-width:78ch;">
        The portal opens when you realize: this is not just coffee.
        When you feel your connection to the Earth through every sip — and your connection to yourself.
